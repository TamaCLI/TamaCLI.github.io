            <h2>🤔 What in the World is TamaCLI?</h2>
            <p>Remember Tamagotchi? Well, we thought, "Why should phones have all the fun?" So we created TamaCLI - a delightful little pet that lives right in your terminal! It's like having a tiny, digital friend who hangs out while you code.</p>
            <p>No more lonely debugging sessions or silent deployments. Your terminal buddy is there to cheer you on with commands like <code>tamacli feed</code> (because even virtual pets get hungry during those long coding sessions).</p>
